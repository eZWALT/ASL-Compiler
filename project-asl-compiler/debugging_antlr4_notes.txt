To develop and debug our grammar, it is useful to visualize the parse trees it builds.

Antlr4 provides grun, a java tool able to provide this visualization.

Since grun is written in java, it requires the java classes for our grammar. Our Makefile creates only C++ classes, so we will need to compile the java version:

antlr4 myGrammar.g4
javac *.java
Once this is done, we can run grun to obtain the tree for a given input:

To display the tree in parenthesized format:

grun myGrammar myInitialSymbol -tree inputfile
To display the tree in graphical format:

grun myGrammar myInitialSymbol -gui inputfile
In both above commands inputfile may be ommited and typed in stdin ending with ctl-D
